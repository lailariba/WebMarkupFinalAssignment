                    Haarlem is well worth the visit, as it boasts 
                    a magnificent variety of shops, companies, and 
                    tourist attractions. It’s a very historical city, 
                    with lots of picturesque old buildings to see, 
                    making tourism an ever-increasing amount of 
                    Haarlem’s income. It is also popular with 
                    day-trippers from Amsterdam due to its close 
                    proximity to the capital. 
                </p>
                <h4>Museums and Historical Buildings</h4>
                <p>
                    The Teylers Museum opened its doors in 
                    the late 18th century and is the oldest 
                    in Holland, making it a must-see for any 
                    tourist visiting The Netherlands. The museum 
                    has a very wide-ranging collection from paintings 
                    and drawings by Michelangelo and Rembrandt, to 
                    fossils and old scientific apparatus. 

                    The Grote Kerk church is a must-see for 
                    any tourist, as it dominates the Grote Markt, 
                    the center market square of Haarlem. This square 
                    is also the center piece for many of Haarlem’s 
                    famous buildings, and is considered the focal point 
                    of the city. A market is held here on Mondays and Saturdays.
